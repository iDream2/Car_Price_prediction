# Car Price Prediction Model

Overview

This project aims to predict the prices of cars using a linear regression model. By analyzing various features of cars such as Car_Name,Year,Selling_Price,Present_Price,Driven_kms,Fuel_Type,Selling_type,Transmission,Owner we can develop a model that provides accurate price predictions. This repository contains the data, code, and instructions necessary to build and evaluate the model.

Features:
Linear Regression model for car price prediction
Data preprocessing and feature engineering
Model evaluation metrics
